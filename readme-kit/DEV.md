# DEV — engineering knowledge

> How this part of the system is built.

## Design decisions

- Config format: YAML is the preferred input with JSON kept at parity (`examples/luffy/` ships both `readme.config.yaml` and `readme.config.json`), so either file shape drives the same build.
- YAML parsing uses the `yaml` npm dependency; the previously hand-rolled parser was deleted rather than kept as a fallback — do not reintroduce a bespoke parser for "zero-dep" reasons.
