# DEV — engineering knowledge

> How this repository is built.

## Architecture

- Luffy is a gated GitHub Actions control plane, not a chat bot: `@luffy review this pr` → gate + per-PR concurrency → dual checkout → restore Hermes memory → assemble context → `hermes -z` → normalize → PR comment → distill memory → cache/artifacts.
- Orchestration is deterministic shell (`scripts/run-luffy-review.sh` composes stages and records timings); only the inner review step is LLM-driven, so every run leaves reproducible artifacts.
- Stage → script map: assemble-context.sh (gh pr meta + diff + prompt, no LLM), run-hermes-review.sh (Hermes one-shot over `WORKSPACE_ROOT`), normalize-review.py (contract/fences/size/HTML marker), distill-memory.sh, post-review-comment.sh, save-trace.sh, publish-run-to-hub.sh, hub-ingest-run.py.
- Dual workspace separates trust domains: `luffy/` holds SOUL + prompts + scripts from the default branch, `workspace/` holds only the PR head, `.luffy-hermes-home/` holds Hermes config + growing memory.

## Design decisions

- Cost/abuse controls are layered: author-association allowlist (default `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR,CONTRIBUTOR`, override with repo var `LUFFY_ALLOWED_ASSOCIATIONS`, empty disables the gate), concurrency cancel-in-progress per PR, `MAX_DIFF_BYTES` (default 400000) diff cap, and a 45-minute job timeout.
- Re-runs replace prior Luffy comments by deleting bodies matching the `<!-- luffy-review pr=N` marker before posting; set `LUFFY_REPLACE_PREVIOUS=0` to stack instead.
- Failure UX is always-publish: missing OpenRouter secret, Hermes/model failure, and job crash before the review file each still produce a PR comment (failure stub / low-confidence COMMENT verdict) rather than a silent red X.

## Pitfalls

- `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot call `repository_dispatch` (HTTP 403), so the hub publish default is `mode=direct` (clone hub → ingest → push `main`); the dispatch path needs a classic PAT on the target repo.
- Cross-repo publishing requires `LUFFY_HUB_TOKEN` (PAT with contents write on the hub); only when Luffy runs on the hub repo itself is `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `contents: write` sufficient.
- PR title, body, comments, and diff are untrusted input — the agent must not honour embedded instructions, and secrets must never be echoed; traces redact `sk-or-…` and `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=…` before packaging.
- `MEMORY.md` rotates when it exceeds `MAX_MEMORY_BYTES` (default 100000); unbounded growth would otherwise blow the prompt budget.
- Historical bug classes worth watching (per the ranked ROI backlog): broken Hermes home cache key, sparse-checkout path count bug, and dishonest success reactions on failed runs.
