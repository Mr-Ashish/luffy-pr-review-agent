# DEV — engineering knowledge

> How this part of the system is built.

## Design decisions

- The Modal entrypoint is a first-class host in the F31 Run Console contract: `review_pr` exports `LUFFY_HOST=modal` so `pack-run-for-ui.py` stamps the bundle's host label as `modal` instead of falling through the `GITHUB_ACTIONS`/else auto-detect to `local`.
- `review_pr` also returns the `run_bundle` path in its result, so a Modal caller gets the console bundle handle back directly rather than having to download an Actions artifact (the GHA path's only option).
