## Transcript / notes

We built and operate Luffy, a comment-triggered PR review agent (Hermes + OpenRouter + hub memory).

Durable knowledge for this repository follows from the architecture and operations below.
Key decisions and workflows to preserve in DEV.md / USAGE.md colocated with the control plane (agent/, scripts/, memory/, .github/).

# Luffy architecture

## One sentence

Luffy is a gated GitHub Actions control plane that assembles a bounded PR context, runs Hermes Agent + OpenRouter with a growing `MEMORY.md`, validates Markdown against a fixed contract, and always publishes the result as a PR comment.

## Flow

```text
@luffy review this pr
    → gate + concurrency
    → dual checkout (luffy/ + workspace/)
    → restore HERMES_HOME memory
    → assemble-context → hermes -z → normalize → PR comment
    → distill MEMORY.md → cache + artifacts
```

## Stages

| Stage | Script | Responsibility |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| Assemble | `scripts/assemble-context.sh` | `gh pr` meta + diff + prompt (no LLM) |
| Review | `scripts/run-hermes-review.sh` | Hermes one-shot on `WORKSPACE_ROOT` |
| Normalize | `scripts/normalize-review.py` | Contract, fences, size, HTML marker |
| Distill | `scripts/distill-memory.sh` | Append structured memory block |
| Post | `scripts/post-review-comment.sh` | Delete prior `<!-- luffy-review pr=N` comments, then `gh pr comment` |
| Orchestrate | `scripts/run-luffy-review.sh` | Compose stages + timings |
| Trace | `scripts/save-trace.sh` | Redacted per-run package → Actions artifact |
| Hub publish | `scripts/publish-run-to-hub.sh` | `repository_dispatch` → hub |
| Hub ingest | `scripts/hub-ingest-run.py` | Commit `memory/repos/{slug}/…` on hub |

## Dual workspace

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `luffy/` | Agent SOUL, prompts, scripts (from default branch) |
| `workspace/` | PR head only (code under review) |
| `.luffy-hermes-home/` | Hermes config + growing memory (cached) |

## Memory layers

1. **L0** — single-run Hermes home  
2. **L1** — Actions cache of `.luffy-hermes-home`  
3. **L2** — workflow artifacts (debug + memory snapshots)  
4. **Distill** — explicit append after each review  

## Security

- PR body/diff treated as untrusted data  
- Least-privilege token permissions  
- Secrets only via env / Hermes `.env` (mode 0600)  
- No formal GitHub “request changes” review API in v1 (comment only)  

## Packaging (future)

Reusable `workflow_call` so app repos only need a thin caller.

# Source: docs/OPERATIONS.md

# Luffy operations

## Required setup

1. Put this project (or at least `agent/`, `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/luffy-pr-review.yml`) on the **default branch** of a GitHub repo.
2. Repository secret: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
3. Optional variable: `LUFFY_MODEL` (default in scripts: `openai/gpt-5-mini`)
4. On a PR, comment: `@luffy review this pr`

## High-ROI fixes

See [ROI-FIXES.md](ROI-FIXES.md) for the ranked backlog.

- **Sprint 1 (F1–F6):** shallow+sparse checkout, Hermes install cache, hub memory preload, drop broken home cache, reactions, shallow hub clone  
- **Sprint 2 (F11–F12):** author association allowlist, replace previous Luffy PR comment  
- **Sprint 3 (F13–F17):** sparse count bugfix, stable Hermes cache key, honest fail reaction, deny 😕, drop dead install copy

## Central hub memory (cross-repo)

All target repos publish each run to the hub:

**Hub:** `Mr-Ashish/luffy-pr-review-agent`  
**Path:** `memory/repos/{owner}--{repo}/`

### Flow

```text
Target Luffy run finishes
  → build-hub-payload.py (redacted, size-capped)
  → publish-run-to-hub.sh
       default mode=direct:
         clone hub → hub-ingest-run.py → commit memory/ → push main
       optional mode=dispatch:
         repository_dispatch luffy-run → Ingest Luffy Run workflow
```

> **Note:** `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot call `repository_dispatch` (HTTP 403).  
> Default **direct** push works with `contents: write` on the hub (self-review) or a PAT on target repos.

### Target repo secrets / vars

| Name | Required | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `LUFFY_HUB_TOKEN` | yes (cross-repo) | PAT with contents write on the hub repo |
| `LUFFY_HUB_REPO` | no | Default `Mr-Ashish/luffy-pr-review-agent` |
| `LUFFY_HUB_MODE` | no | `direct` (default), `dispatch`, or `both` |
| `LUFFY_HUB_PUBLISH` | no | Set `0` to disable |

When Luffy runs **on the hub repo itself**, `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `contents: write` is enough for direct ingest.

### Hub workflow (optional dispatch path)

- File: `.github/workflows/ingest-luffy-run.yml`
- Trigger: `repository_dispatch` type `luffy-run` (needs classic PAT from target)
- Permission: `contents: write`

## Manual dispatch

Actions → **Luffy PR Review** → Run workflow → enter PR number.

## Local dry-run

```bash
cd pr-review-agent
# .env with OPENROUTER_API_KEY
./scripts/review-local.sh owner/repo 123
POST_COMMENT=1 ./scripts/review-local.sh owner/repo 123
```

Requires: `gh` authenticated, network for Hermes install + OpenRouter.

## Failure UX

| Failure | What users see |
|---------|----------------|
| Missing OpenRouter secret | PR comment explaining config error |
| Hermes/model failure | PR comment with low-confidence COMMENT verdict |
| Job crash before review file | Always-post step writes failure stub + comments |

## Cost controls

- Explicit comment trigger only (no auto on every push)
- **Author association allowlist** (default `OWNER,MEMBER,COLLABORATOR,CONTRIBUTOR`) — override with repo variable `LUFFY_ALLOWED_ASSOCIATIONS` (comma list; empty = no gate)
- Concurrency cancel-in-progress per PR
- Diff size cap (`MAX_DIFF_BYTES`, default 400000)
- Job timeout 45 minutes
- Re-runs **replace** prior Luffy comments on the same PR (marker `<!-- luffy-review pr=N`); set `LUFFY_REPLACE_PREVIOUS=0` to stack

## Memory

- Path: `.luffy-hermes-home/memories/MEMORY.md`
- Grows via `distill-memory.sh` after each review
- Rotates when exceeding `MAX_MEMORY_BYTES` (default 100000)
- Gitignored; restored via Actions cache

## Debug

- Download artifact `luffy-out-pr<N>-run<id>` — full `.luffy-out/` + memory snapshot (14 days)
- Download artifact **`luffy-trace-pr<N>-run<id>`** — structured per-run trace (90 days)

### Per-run trace layout

```text
traces/pr{N}-run{RUN_ID}-a{ATTEMPT}/
  meta.json          # identity, status, timings pointer, file hashes
  trace.json         # index
  prompt.md          # agent prompt
  context.md         # PR context
  pr.json / pr.diff  # GitHub PR data
  review.raw.md      # Hermes stdout
  review.md          # normalized posted body
  hermes.stderr      # errors if any
  timings.json       # stage durations
  memory-before.md   # MEMORY.md before review (if any)
  memory-after.md    # MEMORY.md after distill
```

Secrets (`sk-or-…`, `[REDACTED] common `ghp_`/`github_pat_` tokens) are redacted in **posted review bodies** (`normalize-review.py`, F18) and again before trace packaging / hub payload.

```bash
# Download latest trace for a run
gh run download <run-id> -R owner/repo -n luffy-trace-pr1-run<run-id>
```

# F18 (2026-07-31): Secret redaction on posted PR reviews
normalize-review.py now redacts OpenRouter keys (sk-or-v1-…), [REDACTED], api_key-style assignments, and common GitHub tokens (ghp_/gho_/ghu_/ghs_/ghr_ and github_pat_) before writing the review body that gets posted as a PR comment and later distilled. Patterns align with save-trace.sh and build-hub-payload.py so traces, hub payloads, and live comments share the same scrub policy. Redaction runs both before contract repair (so fallback 'raw agent output' is scrubbed) and after ensure_contract.

# agent/ SOUL trust model still applies; F18 is mechanical enforcement at the post choke-point.
