# DEV — engineering knowledge

> How this part of the system is built.

## Architecture

- This repo doubles as the central hub: every target repo's run is ingested under `memory/repos/{owner}--{repo}/` (slug uses `--` to flatten owner/repo), holding `MEMORY.md`, `latest.json`, and a `runs/` history.
- Publish path: `build-hub-payload.py` produces a redacted, size-capped payload → `publish-run-to-hub.sh` (direct push by default, `repository_dispatch luffy-run` optional) → `hub-ingest-run.py` commits under `memory/`.
- Hub memory is preloaded into `HERMES_HOME` at the start of each run (`preload-hub-memory.sh`), which is what makes the next review on the same repo smarter — memory is cross-run and cross-repo, not per-job.
- Hub behaviour is env-configurable per target repo: `LUFFY_HUB_REPO` (default `Mr-Ashish/luffy-pr-review-agent`), `LUFFY_HUB_MODE` (`direct`|`dispatch`|`both`), `LUFFY_HUB_PUBLISH=0` to disable.

## Pitfalls

- Direct push therefore needs write on the hub: on the hub repo itself `GITHUB_TOKEN` + `contents: write` is sufficient (self-review), but any *other* target repo requires `LUFFY_HUB_TOKEN` (PAT with contents write on the hub) or hub publishing silently degrades.
- Original failure mode this layer exists to fix: hub memory was written after a run but **not loaded into** the next review — the preload step is the load half of the contract, and without it the `memory/` tree is write-only.
