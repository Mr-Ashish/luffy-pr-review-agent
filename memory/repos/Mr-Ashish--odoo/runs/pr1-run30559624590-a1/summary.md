- Source: `Mr-Ashish/odoo` PR #1
- Status: success
- Model: openai/gpt-5-mini
- Verdict: REQUEST CHANGES
- Blocking: - In addons/website_cf_turnstile/static/src/interactions/turnstile.js, the success callback assigned to globalThis[successCbName] (around lines 34–50) does:   const form = turnstileContainer.closest("form") || turnstileContainer.parentElement;   If turnstileContainer is null/undefined (e.g. removed or not created due to a race), calling .closest(...) will throw. Please add an early guard to avoid this crash. Example fixes (pick one):   - Early return:     if (!turnstileContainer) { return; }   -
- Summary: This PR hardens Cloudflare Turnstile form callbacks in addons/website_cf_turnstile/static/src/interactions/turnstile.js by adding safer handling around visibility and validation. The intention is correct and the changes mostly improve robustness, but there is a remaining race that can still throw in the success callback.
