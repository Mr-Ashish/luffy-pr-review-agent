# Luffy review memory — `Mr-Ashish/odoo`

Cumulative notes from Luffy PR reviews (hub-ingested).

## Review run pr1-run30558836212-a1
- Source: `Mr-Ashish/odoo` PR #1
- Status: success
- Model: openai/gpt-5-mini
- Verdict: REQUEST CHANGES
- Blocking: - Please add a guard for turnstileContainer at the top of the success callback (globalThis[successCbName]). Right now the callback does:   const form = turnstileContainer.closest("form") || turnstileContainer.parentElement;   If turnstileContainer is null/removed before this callback runs, that line will throw. Either:   - return early if turnstileContainer is falsy, or   - use optional chaining when resolving form (e.g. turnstileContainer?.closest(...)).    File / symbol to change: addons/websi
- Summary: This PR hardens the Cloudflare Turnstile callbacks in addons/website_cf_turnstile/static/src/interactions/turnstile.js by guarding against null form/input races and fixes a comment typo (fingerprinting). The changes are small, focused, and move the callbacks toward safer runtime behavior when DOM elements vanish due to races.
- Trigger: @luffy review this pr
